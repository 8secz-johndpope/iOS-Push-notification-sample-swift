# Flurry Marketing Sample Application (Swift Version)

This is an swift version sample app based on Flurry Push service. See [Objective-c version](https://git.ouroath.com/yxu03/FlurryMarketingSample) here. Flurry Push enables external app developers to send targeted messages to re-engage and retain users.<br/>

Detailed instructions are written in [Yahoo Developer Network Website](https://developer.yahoo.com/flurry/docs/push/integration/ios/). Developers can choose either auto integration mode or manual integration mode. For auto mode, please uncomment line 36 - 38 and comment line 41 - 60 and line 125 - 161. For the manual mode, do the opposite. Flurry Push Campaign can be created or modified in [Flurry Analytics Portal](https://dev.flurry.com). If this is the first time that you use the Flurry SDK, please see this [link](https://developer.yahoo.com/flurry/docs/integrateflurry/ios/) first to see how to integrate Flurry SDK into your own iOS project. <br/>

In this sample project, there are three views. They are home view (landing page), deeplink view and key-value view. When starting a campaign in the flurry analytics portal, developers can have several options besides basic notification attributes. One of them is deeplinking. Developers can specify a location in the app after a notification being clicked. In this sample app, if the deeplink is set to flurry://marketing/deeplink, the deeplink view will show up. Another option is that developers can pass any key-value pairs as part of notification payload to devices. Key-value view will show all the key-value pairs.
